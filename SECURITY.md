## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Music Analyzer Pro seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should **never** be reported via public GitHub issues.

### 2. Email Security Team

Send details to: security@musicanalyzerpro.example.com

Include:
- Type of vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-2 weeks
  - High: 2-4 weeks
  - Medium: 1-2 months
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Measures

### API Keys and Secrets

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly
- Implement rate limiting

### Data Protection

- User data is stored locally
- No telemetry without consent
- Encrypted sensitive data storage
- Secure file handling

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning
- Vulnerability monitoring via GitHub Dependabot

### Code Security

- Input validation on all user inputs
- Safe file operations
- Secure audio file parsing
- SQL injection prevention

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Personal information

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - File paths
   - User-supplied data
   - Network requests

3. **Use secure functions**
   - Parameterized queries for database
   - Safe file operations
   - Proper error handling

4. **Review dependencies**
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Minimize dependency count
   - Use official packages

## Known Security Considerations

### Audio File Processing
- Validate file formats before processing
- Limit file sizes to prevent DoS
- Sanitize metadata extraction

### Database Operations
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backups

### AI Integration
- Secure API key storage
- Rate limiting on API calls
- Data sanitization before sending to APIs

## Security Tools

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated alerts
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Prevent secret commits

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10 recommendations
- Python security best practices
- Data protection principles
